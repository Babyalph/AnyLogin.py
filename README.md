# AnyLogin.py
Bot that tries the given Username/Mail and Password on many Websites (like Instagram, Spotify, Mcdonalds, Snapchat, LinkedIn....)

This is an early Version so it only Features Instagram, Spotify, LinkedIn, Snapchat and Mcdonalds.
I will add many more webseits soon and a Feature to commit a List of more Users and Passwords at once.

# User List Version
You can give the Bot a List with multible Users and Passwords now.

The List has to be named List.txt and formated like this:
```
peter123@gmail.com 123456789
sofia123@gmail.com 87654321
```
The pogramm takes around 50 seconds per user so I recommend running it in the Background.
